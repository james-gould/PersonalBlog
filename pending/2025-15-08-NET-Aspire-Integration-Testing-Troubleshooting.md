# Introduction

- XUnit default template
- Create fixture
- Requires inclusion of csproj items
- cannot abstract fixture (or no point)
- Mention warning from XUNIT, get code from sample
- Ignore the Github as things are changing, ref MS: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/testing/write-your-first-test?pivots=xunit
- Can abstract Fixture and CreateClient, no need to do it all in each test
